# Herald-of-Trade

This project is a fork of [PoE-Trends](https://github.com/achakilum/PoE-Trends) with updates and new features tailored for the latest league settings in Path of Exile.

I mainly forked PoE-Trends to learn Android development.

Herald-of-Trade is a Path of Exile helper app designed to assist players when they are not in the game. This app aims to provide useful tools for ideating new crafts, checking prices, and strategizing new farming methods.
